### Problem Statement
 Looking for a specific menu item you want requires visually scanning many menus with no certainty of finding it. Also, even if a restaurant is highly rated overall, there's no way to know if a specific dish is good or bad. Finally, while customers may give comments on specific dishes in their reviews, this information is qualitative and disorganized - there is no easy way for a restaurant owner to get quantitative, organized data on individual menu offerings.

### How to solve?
Search by menu item, store individual dish ratings, offer by-dish reports.

### Features to be implemented
+   Geolocation
+   server-side data persistence
+   client-side data persistence
+   front-end framework
+   web scraping
+   reporting with charts and graphs

We will only scrape a limited number of menus for the prototype

#### Data used & collected 
+   Location
+	menus (scraped from Yelp)
+	dish ratings and the time/date of their submission
+	dish being searched

### Algorithms or special techniques
Algorithm for ranking dishes by rating and location, algorithm for generating charts/graphs, scraping and formatting algorithms.

#Comments by Ming:
1. What you have listed for features are not features. Briefly describe for what will you be using SMS, reporting, geolocation for.
2. Be very careful with data scraping --it is ugly
3. Overall score: 13/15
